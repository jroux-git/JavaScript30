    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';

    console.table(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'wes',
      age: 100,
      social:{
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    console.log(wes);

    const wes2 = Object.assign(wes);

    // This is just a ref so wes will also have changed
    wes2.social.twitter = '@coolman';
    console.log(wes.social.twitter);
    console.log(wes2.social.twitter);

    // easy deep clone
    const wes3 = JSON.parse(wes.stringify(wes));
